In the past when a member of a team has been problematic in a seriously detrimental way, 
I would usually try to reallocate them so that those issues have a smaller impact.
This has worked out because team based projects so far have been low stakes enough where weaknessess in the team
could be patched this way instead of bringing up the members. 

However a long term project where understanding is essential will require bringing up the team members. The pointers 
on giving and receiving feedback seem very useful specifically being specific and timely. This way I feel like instead 
of possibly being annoyed, the moment of a problem behavior or practice will feel like an oportunity to address team cohesion. 
(In the right environment ofcourse)
